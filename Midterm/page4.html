            <h3>A clip from the popular movie, Good Will Hunting, that displays another dialogue between two characters talking about the love they have for
                <br>certain people. In the dialogue, the professor tells an evocative story about how he met his wife to the student who asked the question,
                <br>“When did you know she was the one for you?”. He builds up the story with an enticing recap of a monumental moment for the baseball community
                <br>from a specific match, exciting the student as he is told the professor got tickets for the match. However, his recap abruptly ends as the professor
                <br>says he was not there to watch the moment as he had eyes on something more important, the woman who became his wife. Through the dialogue,
                <br>the professor’s love for his late wife was emanating throughout their conversation — leaving his student with food for thought. The whole clip
                <br>exhibits love through the professor, the actors, and the writing, helping the overall film garner massive popularity despite it not being recent.
